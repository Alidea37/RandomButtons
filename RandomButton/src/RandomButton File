Description:

This program is a game that allows players three chances to select a button that reveals their move through a haunted castle.
Players start out in the middle of the castle and have to choose which direction they want to go.
Players have the option of leaving the castle at any time via the End Game button.
Each button is randomized so selecting it more than once may result in a different ending.
The action listener counts the number of selections the user makes and ends the game if the player tries to select a button after their third try.
